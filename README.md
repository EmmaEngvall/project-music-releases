# Music Releases
This week we practiced React and creating components by using data from Spotify. We built a page which shows new album and single releases. This project was done by pair programming. 

## The problem
To have the icons placed over the album cover was a challenge. We solved it by creating an icon-container. The other major challenge was the hover effects for the different states but we got there in the end.
